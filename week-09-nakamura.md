The mental structure of people has been wired to a specific routine. People stick to certain apps, the ones that they feel comfortable with. For example, some people may be more Instagram users, this may be because the online profile that they have created for themselves may be one that they can relate to the most too. There are many emails as well, Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, and Hotmail all are just platforms that offer the same service but have different preferences. 
One identity is made up of all the digital profiles they have open to the public. Manovich says "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure" hits the spot. using tik tok, and Instagram, and sharing reels, feeds, and videos interacts with others' mental structure. These apps we use are designed to interact and build a profile.
