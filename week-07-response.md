James Bridle is a writer and artist that takes on the Internet and more specifically, Youtube. The article itself is very interesting since it targets parts of youtube that get’s ignored. The author takes a guess at what is looked down upon when it comes to the platform, the children and infant side of this company is something that doesn't get enough attention. he brings in various topics that maybe a bit sensitive and even uncomfortable. for example, in the article, he mentions that there is a side of YouTube that is truly weird, there are videos that have very odd content and are usually viewed by children and people who don't really watch youtube. there are videos that really have no theme, no idea, no thought into it, it really seems like it is just a video of Randomness and weirdness. these videos still get views somehow the audience finds these videos when ignoring the YouTube video that they have originally placed. some of these videos may seem a bit inappropriate, yet it is the younger generation that usually enjoys this oddness of videos. for example, he mentions the Finger Family song which is weird in a harmless and nursery rhyme video. the video itself has a song that is created to Target younger kids even babies. but when one really takes a look at the video the awkwardness and weirdness are just all over the content. there are other videos like farm animals finger family and more animal songs that really have no theme or idea, yet they get over 2 million views. stepping away from the YouTube content, there are many things in the internet that should be getting more attention, yet get hidden in place in the shadows of under vision. for example, the case of the” keep calm and rape a lot t-shirts”  is something that is very concerning yet is something that is available for purchase in a website as big as amazon. the truth is there is plenty of weird and inappropriate content on the internet that will never ever be monitored or controlled by any supervisor since the internet itself is immense.

Do I agree with these huge and bold claims, yes? the internet should be a resource and a tool that will help humans and science evolve and create new solutions for the world with fast Ai and Rapid answering machines. instead, the internet has become a place where weirdness is accepted, and inappropriate material seems to be okay in part of the internet. Parents should really watch what the children watch since they are the future of the human race and should be fed not weird content, but intellectual and nourishing content.
