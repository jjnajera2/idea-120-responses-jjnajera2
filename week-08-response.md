Propaganda is a very sensitive topic since it goes into various topics. Propaganda can indeed be a good tool to bring people in and inform or educate, but this can stop being a tool and become a weapon. Propaganda can be obsessive and just like O'Neil mentioned, "the coming avalanche of personalized advertising would be so useful" would become the "weakest part of his argument". Having an avalanche would not be helpful to anyone in any circumstance. I think that ads and personalized messages should be reduced to certain scenarios and not in every single website that one visits.   There should be places where the ads should be expected like in online stores when one is buying and spending money. on the other hand, when one is trying to read an article, searching up anything on reviews, or even searching up a score. This is when one is trying to accomplish a target, finding out a set piece of information, but then the avalanche intrudes in the way and makes everything so much harder to accomplish. 
Just like there are times to push for having no ads, there are times when one does need the personalized ads to come in and offer options. Times in which ads would be helpful are when buying tickets, browsing for anything in retail stores, or buying anything in general. These ar instances when having options may bee helpful, and when the mentality is opened to spending money.
